  ### Incoming Parameters
    Name	Type	Value
    error	string	access_denied
    error_description	string	The user denied the request

  ** note **
    Most other errors, such as invalid scopes or missing parameters, will be returned to your redirect_uri in a similar fashion. The only     exceptions are if the client_id is invalid or the redirect_uri is not associated with that oauth app. In those situations, the errors     will just be displayed on the screen so not to redirect the user to potentially malicious URLs. If the user allows the request and    
    there are no errors, they will be redirected to the redirect URI with two query parameters
