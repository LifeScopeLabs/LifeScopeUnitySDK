# 2. Install Dependencies
You will need to have node.js and \`npm\` installed on your machine so that you can install the backend's dependencies before uploading the code to Lambda.

From the 'lambda' directory run

`npm install`

to install all of the project-wide dependencies, then go to the lambda/src/ directory and again run

`npm install`

This will install all of the node_modules that are needed to build and run the demo.
